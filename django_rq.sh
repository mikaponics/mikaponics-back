# script:

# (1) This project must be located in the following directory:
#     "/opt/django/mikaponics-back"
# (2) The "env" variable has already been initialized with the projects
#     requirements.txt file.
# (3) The operating system is "CentOS 7".
# (4) There is a "django" user account created on the "CentOS 7" system.
